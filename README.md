# Tower-Defense-Game
A tower defense game where the player places down ants to defend against bees similar to plants vs zombies. Each ants costs food to place. A harvester ant generates food, a thrower ant throws leaves at the bees, a fire ant reflects damage taken back at the bees and damages the bees when it dies, a hungry ant eats a bee once every 3 turns, a short thrower only targets bees at a short distance but costs less, a long thrower only targets bees at long distance but costs less, a wall ant takes a lot of damage, a scubatrhower can be placed in a water block and is a thrower ant, and the queen ant is a scubathrouwer but can also double the damage of all the ants behind it, but the player looses if the queen ant dies
